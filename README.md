# NASA-APOTD

This was a five day solo project at Turing School of Software and Design where we built a front end Vue.js app using the [NASA Astronomy Photo of the Day Api](https://api.nasa.gov/index.html#apply-for-an-api-key). It allows a user to fetch the photo of the day for today, and all of the photos taken that month. The user can then click through those photos and pick which ones they want to view, and go back to todays photo.

## Learning Goals

- Professional workflow.
- Ability to build an app using a new language that we have not been taught.
- Deploying to Heroku
